# Backend Architecture

The backend automatically initiates the self-configuring model generation task, handling all necessary configurations without user intervention. The training process is managed through dedicated workflows that support scheduling, tracking, and monitoring of progress. Upon completion, the system deploys the model to the models bank, making it immediately available for inference via the CUBE.AI platform.'
