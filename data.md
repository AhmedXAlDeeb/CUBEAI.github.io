# Data Management

The system stores each created workflow in a relational database (PostgreSQL), including unique identifiers for each case and the corresponding labels. Following annotation, labels are uploaded back to the PACS server. Detailed metadata, such as the Series Instance UID and other relevant attributes, are stored in the database.

The platform prepares the dataset for the self-configuring model by transferring data from the PACS server to the segmentation server, organizing the data, and setting up the computational environment and resource allocations.



    
# PACS Overview

<details>
<summary><strong>üì¶ Definition: What is a DICOM PACS Server?</strong></summary>    
    DICOM stands for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine, a global standard for transmitting, storing, and sharing medical images and associated data. PACS, or Picture Archiving and Communication System, is a medical imaging technology that provides economical storage, easy access, and comprehensive management of images from multiple modalities, such as X-ray, MRI, and CT scans.
    
    A DICOM PACS server is a specialized server that stores these images in a standard DICOM format and facilitates their retrieval and viewing by healthcare professionals through networked devices.
    
    **Key Components of a DICOM PACS Server**
    
    1. **Image Acquisition Devices**: These include imaging modalities like MRI, CT, ultrasound, and X-ray machines that generate digital medical images in the DICOM format.
    2. **PACS Server**: The heart of the system, this server stores the images and provides the necessary infrastructure to retrieve, archive, and manage the images.
    3. **Workstations**: These are the computers or terminals used by radiologists and other healthcare providers to view, interpret, and analyze the medical images.
    4. **RIS (Radiology Information System)**: Often integrated with PACS, the RIS handles patient data, scheduling, and management of imaging records, complementing the PACS's image storage and retrieval functions.
    5. **DICOM Viewer**: A software application installed on the workstations that allows medical professionals to view and manipulate the DICOM images.
    
    **How a DICOM PACS Server Works: Step-by-Step Workflow**
    
    1. **Image Acquisition**
    
    The process begins with the acquisition of medical images using various imaging modalities. These devices, such as MRI and CT scanners, generate images in the DICOM format, which includes not only the visual data but also metadata containing patient information and imaging parameters.
    
    1. **DICOM Image Transfer**
    
    Once the images are captured, they are automatically sent to the PACS server over the hospital network using the DICOM protocol. This ensures that the images, along with their associated metadata, are securely transmitted and stored in a standardized format.
    
    1. **Image Storage**
    
    Upon receiving the images, the PACS server stores them in a centralized database. The server is designed to handle large volumes of data, ensuring that images are archived securely and can be retrieved quickly when needed. The server may also create backups to prevent data loss.
    
    1. **Worklist Management**
    
    The PACS server is often integrated with the Radiology Information System (RIS), which manages patient data and scheduling. The RIS generates a worklist for radiologists, listing the studies that need to be reviewed. This integration allows the PACS server to prioritize and manage imaging studies efficiently.
    
    1. **Image Retrieval and Viewing**
    
    When a healthcare provider needs to review an image, they can access the PACS server through a DICOM viewer installed on their workstation. The PACS server retrieves the requested images and displays them on the viewer, allowing the provider to analyze and interpret the images. The viewer often includes tools for enhancing and manipulating the images to aid in diagnosis.
    
    1. **Reporting and Distribution**
    
    After the radiologist or healthcare provider reviews the images, they can generate a report based on their findings. This report is often stored alongside the images on the PACS server and can be shared with other healthcare providers, ensuring that the patient's care team has access to the same information.

    ```
    
    ---
    
    ### üîç Breakdown of Each Link:
    
    ### ‚úÖ 1. **Orthanc ‚Üî PostgreSQL**
    
    - Orthanc uses a PostgreSQL database (if configured) to store all DICOM **metadata**, such as:
        - Patient name, study date, modality type
        - Study, series, and instance UIDs
    - The actual image files are stored on disk or cloud storage.
    
    ### ‚úÖ 2. **pgAdmin ‚Üî PostgreSQL**
    
    - pgAdmin connects to this same PostgreSQL database and lets you:
        - Browse the tables used by Orthanc
        - View metadata for studies and images
        - Run queries to filter or analyze imaging records
        - Inspect how Orthanc structures its internal data (patients, studies, series, etc.)
    
    ### ‚úÖ 3. **OHIF ‚Üî Orthanc**
    
    - OHIF uses **DICOMweb APIs** (QIDO-RS and WADO-RS) to:
        - Request metadata from Orthanc ‚Üí Orthanc queries the PostgreSQL DB
        - Fetch images ‚Üí Orthanc serves them from its file system

    ## Your Setup Components
    
    | Component | Role |
    | --- | --- |
    | **OHIF Viewer** | Frontend web app for viewing medical images |
    | **Orthanc** | PACS server (backend) that stores DICOM files and metadata |
    | **pgAdmin** | GUI to manage the PostgreSQL database used by Orthanc |
    
    ---
    
    ## How It All Reflects on Orthanc's Internal Structure
    
    ### üü© 1. **Orthanc‚Äôs Internal Services Handle Requests from OHIF**
    
    - When you open **OHIF**, it talks to Orthanc using the **DICOMweb plugin**:
        - **QIDO-RS**: OHIF asks ‚ÄúWhat studies are available?‚Äù
        - **WADO-RS**: OHIF says ‚ÄúShow me this image.‚Äù
    - These requests go through Orthanc‚Äôs **internal DICOMweb services** (enabled via a plugin).
    - Orthanc:
        - Queries its **PostgreSQL database** for metadata (e.g., study date, patient ID).
        - Reads DICOM image files from disk or object storage.
        - Sends the response back to OHIF.
    
    ‚úÖ **So the querying, web access, and DICOM handling are happening inside Orthanc** (some via plugins).
    
    ---
    
    ### üü¶ 2. **Orthanc Uses PostgreSQL to Store Metadata**
    
    - Orthanc stores DICOM metadata (not images!) in **PostgreSQL**:
        - Patients
        - Studies
        - Series
        - Instances
    - This is what OHIF searches and filters against.
    
    ---
    
    ### üü® 3. **pgAdmin Lets You View and Explore That Metadata**
    
    - pgAdmin connects directly to the **PostgreSQL database** used by Orthanc.
    - Through pgAdmin, you can:
        - See the same study metadata OHIF uses.
        - Write custom SQL queries (e.g., find all CT scans from 2024).
        - Debug or audit what's stored in the PACS.
    
    ‚úÖ **pgAdmin doesn't connect to OHIF ‚Äî it connects to the backend DB shared by Orthanc.**
    
    ---
    
    ## üîÑ How It All Works Together ‚Äî End to End:
    
    ```
    [Doctor uploads scan] ‚Üí [Orthanc]
                             ‚Üì
                    (Stores DICOM files on disk)
                    (Stores metadata in PostgreSQL)
                             ‚Üì
                   [pgAdmin can view/edit metadata]
                             ‚Üì
                   [OHIF requests metadata/images]
                             ‚Üë
                 (Orthanc handles this via DICOMweb)
    
    ```

    # üåê DICOMweb API: The Web-Based Bridge Between PACS and Viewers
    
    ## üìå What Is DICOMweb API?
    
    **DICOMweb** is a modern, web-friendly version of the DICOM standard. It defines **RESTful APIs** for accessing medical imaging data (like CT, MRI, and X-rays) using **HTTP and JSON/XML** ‚Äî just like a typical web service.
    
    > In simple terms:
    > 
    > 
    > üß† **DICOMweb = DICOM over HTTP**, designed for web apps and cloud environments.
    > 
    
    ---
    
    ## üß† Why DICOMweb Exists
    
    Traditional DICOM relies on older networking protocols (like C-FIND, C-STORE) that are:
    
    - Hard to use with web or mobile apps
    - Complex to integrate in cloud systems
    
    DICOMweb solves this by:
    
    - Using familiar web technologies (URLs, JSON, REST)
    - Enabling easy access for tools like **OHIF Viewer**, **AI pipelines**, and **mobile apps**
    
    ---
    
    ## Where DICOMweb Fits in Your System
    
    Here‚Äôs how it connects OHIF and Orthanc:
    
    ```
    [OHIF Viewer (Web)] ‚Üê REST API ‚Üí [Orthanc PACS Server] ‚Üê‚Üí [PostgreSQL + DICOM files]
                             ‚Üë
                      Uses DICOMweb API
    
    ```
    
    - **OHIF** uses DICOMweb to:
        - Search for studies (QIDO-RS)
        - Download images (WADO-RS)
        - Upload scans (STOW-RS)
    - **Orthanc** uses built-in services or plugins to support these endpoints.
    - **PostgreSQL** (visible via pgAdmin) stores the metadata for these images.
    
    ---
    
    ## Main DICOMweb API Types & Endpoints
    
    ### 1. üîç **QIDO-RS (Query based on ID for DICOM Objects)**
    
    **Purpose**: Search for metadata (not the images themselves)
    
    | Endpoint | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `GET /dicom-web/studies` | List all studies |
    | `GET /dicom-web/studies?PatientName=John*` | Filter by patient name |
    | `GET /dicom-web/studies/{StudyUID}/series` | List all series in a study |
    | `GET /dicom-web/studies/{StudyUID}/series/{SeriesUID}/instances` | List image instances in a series |
    
    Used by OHIF to show available patients or studies before loading the images.
    
    ---
    
    ### 2. üì• **WADO-RS (Web Access to DICOM Objects)**
    
    **Purpose**: Retrieve actual DICOM image data or metadata.
    
    | Endpoint | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `GET /dicom-web/studies/{StudyUID}` | Study metadata |
    | `GET /dicom-web/studies/{StudyUID}/series/{SeriesUID}` | Series metadata |
    | `GET /dicom-web/studies/{StudyUID}/series/{SeriesUID}/instances/{InstanceUID}` | Single image instance |
    | `GET /dicom-web/studies/{StudyUID}/series/{SeriesUID}/instances/{InstanceUID}/frames/1` | A specific image frame (used in CT/MRI stacks) |
    
    üñºÔ∏è This is how OHIF actually loads and displays the medical images in your browser.
    
    ---
    
    ### 3. üì§ **STOW-RS (Store over the Web)**
    
    **Purpose**: Upload DICOM images using HTTP.
    
    | Endpoint | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `POST /dicom-web/studies` | Upload new DICOM files |
    
    üß™ Useful in cloud PACS, AI tools, or browser-based DICOM uploaders.
