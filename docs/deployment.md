# Automated and Dynamic Model Development

CUBE.AI overcomes nnU-Net’s complexity by integrating a generic segmentation framework on top of MONAI Label. Radiologists can now initialize, train, and deploy models with a single click—no coding required.

### Key Features:
- **Model Generation**: Initializes tasks with all settings.
- **Training**: Handles scheduling and tracking.
- **Deployment**: Automatically uploads trained models to the model bank.

This end-to-end pipeline makes real-time clinical model development accessible to non-technical users.
