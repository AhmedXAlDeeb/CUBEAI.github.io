# Frontend & Workflow

The frontend includes a workflow module to manage segmentation tasks. Each workflow corresponds to a specific segmentation task. Users can now add cases directly from the PACS server. After creating a workflow and adding the relevant studies (cases), annotation can begin using foundational models that have been integrated to assist in label generation.
